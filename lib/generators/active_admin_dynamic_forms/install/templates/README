ActiveAdminDynamicForms has been successfully installed!

Here's what was done:

1. Created database migrations for dynamic forms
2. Added an initializer at config/initializers/active_admin_dynamic_forms.rb
3. Added an Active Admin resource at app/admin/dynamic_form.rb
4. Mounted the engine at /active_admin_dynamic_forms
5. Added asset links to app/assets/config/manifest.js

Next steps:

1. Run the migrations:
   $ rails db:migrate

2. Restart your server:
   $ rails server

3. Visit your Active Admin dashboard and look for the "Dynamic Forms" menu item

4. To associate a model with dynamic forms, add this to your model:
   
   class YourModel < ApplicationRecord
     has_dynamic_form
   end

5. To display a dynamic form in your views:
   
   <%= dynamic_form_for(@your_model) %>
